# 🎨 PHP Design Patterns  

Welcome to my learning journey! 🚀  
This repository is where I **practice, experiment, and share** what I’m learning about **Design Patterns in PHP**.  

I’m not an expert yet  — I’m still learning step by step.  
But I believe that **sharing while learning** is the best way to grow and help others 💡.

## 📚 What’s Inside?  

This repository is structured to help you **learn design patterns step by step**.  
Each pattern has its **own folder**, and inside it you will find two subfolders:  

- **`before/`** 🟥  
  - Contains the code **before applying the pattern**.  
  - Shows the real problem (tight coupling, if/else hell, etc.).  
  - Includes a `Problem.md` file that **explains the issue in detail**.  

- **`after/`** 🟩  
  - Contains the **refactored code after applying the pattern**.  
  - Shows the clean solution using the chosen design pattern.  
  - Includes a `Solution.md` file that **explains how the pattern solves the problem**.

## 🎯 Why this repo?  
- To **document my journey** in understanding design patterns.  
- To make concepts easier for me (and maybe for you too ✨).  
- To show how patterns improve **code quality, flexibility, and scalability**.
